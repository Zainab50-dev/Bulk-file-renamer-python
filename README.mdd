A simple Python project that automatically renames all files inside a folder. Each file keeps its original extension, and the program adds numbering (file1, file2...).

1. User enters the folder path
2. Program collects all files inside that folder
3. Each file is renamed with numbering 
4. Errors are handled so the program does not stop suddenly
